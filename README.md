### "Hello everybody"

As a professional in transition, I have a combination of design and front-end development skills. 
While my professional experience has been focused on design and advertising, since 2018 I have been pursuing continuous learning in front-end development. 
I possess technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and their respective frameworks such as Bootstrap and React.js.

Would you like to find me?
